## Details

EpiModel provides tools for the mathematical modeling of infectious
diseases. Supported model classes include stochastic network models,
which rely on the statistical framework of exponential-family random
graph models (ERGMs) that evolve over time. This allows for modeling of
disease-related contacts with duration, such as ongoing sexual
partnerships.

The level of statistical complexity of these models, based in
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, results in computationally
intensive simulation processes. The goal of EpiModelHPC is to provide a
standardized framework for extending EpiModel to run on modern
high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
