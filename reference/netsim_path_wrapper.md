# Run Single Simulations From a Restart Pool or a Single Object

Runs one
[`EpiModel::netsim`](https://epimodel.github.io/EpiModel/reference/netsim.html)
call with a single simulation for each element of `sim_nums`, in
parallel with
[`future.apply::future_lapply`](https://future.apply.futureverse.org/reference/future_lapply.html)
(using the current `future` plan).

## Usage

``` r
netsim_path_wrapper(path_to_x, param, init, control, sim_nums)
```

## Arguments

- path_to_x:

  Path to a restart pool directory (holding a `pool_index.csv`), or to a
  single file saved with `saveRDS` (a fitted network model or a restart
  point, see the `x` argument to
  [`EpiModel::netsim`](https://epimodel.github.io/EpiModel/reference/netsim.html)).

- param:

  Model parameters, as an object of class
  [`param.net`](https://epimodel.github.io/EpiModel/reference/param.net.html).
  Includes transmission probability (`inf.prob`), act rate (`act.rate`),
  recovery rate (`rec.rate`), and demographic rates for models with
  vital dynamics. Custom parameters for extended models may also be
  passed through `param.net`.

- init:

  Initial conditions, as an object of class
  [`init.net`](https://epimodel.github.io/EpiModel/reference/init.net.html).
  Specifies the initial number of infected nodes (`i.num`) and, for SIR
  models, recovered nodes (`r.num`). For two-group models, the
  corresponding `.g2` parameters are also required.

- control:

  Control settings, as an object of class
  [`control.net`](https://epimodel.github.io/EpiModel/reference/control.net.html).
  Key settings include `type` (disease model: `"SI"`, `"SIR"`, or
  `"SIS"`), `nsteps` (number of time steps), `nsims` (number of
  simulations), `tergmLite` (lightweight mode for performance), and
  `resimulate.network` (required for models with vital dynamics). For
  extended models, custom module functions are also passed here.

- sim_nums:

  The simulation numbers to run, used to pick the pool elements.

## Value

A list of `netsim` objects with one simulation each, in the order of
`sim_nums`.

## Details

If `path_to_x` is a restart pool directory (one holding a
`pool_index.csv`, see `make_restart_pool`) of `N` elements, simulation
`k` starts from pool element `(k - 1) %% N + 1`: the pool is reused in
order when there are more simulations than pool elements; the path of
the restart point used is saved in `$restart_point`. Before any
simulation starts, the elements used are checked to have been made with
the installed major.minor version of EpiModel, according to
`pool_index.csv`. `netsim` checks the version of each restart point
again when it starts. If `path_to_x` is a file, every simulation starts
from it (from its first simulation if it holds several).

`control$nsims`, `control$ncores` and `control$future.use.plan` are
overridden. As `netsim` does for several simulations, `control$verbose`
is set to `FALSE` when `sim_nums` has more than one element. If
`control$.checkpoint.dir` is set, each simulation checkpoints in its own
`<.checkpoint.dir>/sim_<k>` sub directory.

Use `validate_restart_pool` to check a pool before using it.
