Title: EpiModel Extensions for High-Performance Computing
Description: Extension package to EpiModel to run large-scale stochastic network
    models on modern high-performance computing systems. Functionality provided to
    simulate models in parallel using single-node, multiple-core setups. Check-pointing
    functions that automatically save and restore simulation work, which may be
    useful on HPC systems with Portable Batch System (PBS) job scheduling software
    like OpenPBS, are also included.
