Title: EpiModel Extensions for High-Performance Computing
Description: Extension package to EpiModel to run large-scale stochastic network models
      on modern high-performance computing systems. Functionality provided to simulate models in
      parallel using either single-node, multiple-core or multiple-node setups. Check-pointing
      functions that automatically save and restore simulation work, which may be particularly
      useful on HPC systems with Portable Batch System (PBS) job scheduling software like
      OpenPBS, are also included.
